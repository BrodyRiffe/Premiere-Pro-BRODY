Summary
In this essay, I talk about how the behind-the-scenes choices filmmakers make—like how a scene is filmed, how fast or slow the story moves, and how music and sound are used—affect how we feel while watching a TV show or movie. These choices can make us feel excited, scared, sad, or happy. I wanted to show that these decisions are just as important as the story itself, and understanding them can help us enjoy shows more. If I were making a video essay, I would use clips from shows like Breaking Bad and The Witcher to show how the camera, pacing, and sound affect the mood of a scene. This would help people see how these choices work in action, making my points easier to understand. A video essay would let me show exactly how filmmakers make us feel different things. While writing this essay, I learned a lot about filmmaking techniques, especially how pacing and sound are used to build tension. I also learned how to use Premiere Pro to edit and organize a video essay. This helped me figure out how to present my ideas in a clear and interesting way. Feedback from my classmates really helped improve my essay. It made me focus more on examples and helped me make my ideas easier to understand. The suggestions I got helped me make my argument stronger and the essay more organized. Overall, the feedback made my final project better and easier for people to enjoy.
For my project, I looked at how behind-the-scenes choices in movies and TV shows affect how we feel. I used Premiere Pro to add pictures to show how things like camera angles, pacing, and sound impact the audience’s emotions. I explained how, for example, different camera shots can make an action scene feel exciting or how the speed of a scene can make us feel tense. By editing these examples, I explained how filmmakers use these tools to make us feel different emotions while watching a show or movie.
